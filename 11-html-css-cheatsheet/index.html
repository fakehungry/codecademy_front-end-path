        struture a web page. The hyper text is use to reference to another
        website.

        HTML commonly structure a code in tag. Normally, there're opening tag,
        body, and closing tag. The opening tag is a starter of a command. It's
        also include any attribute in the opening tag. The body is a content of
        the opening and closing tag. If you want to tell viewer anything you can
        do it in the body. The last one is the closing tag. It's just a closing
        for the opening tag. Some tags we're call it "self closing tag" because
        it's already close with "/" in the opening tag.

      CSS is a langauge that use to style our structure (HTML). It can style
      HTML in 3 different ways. The inline style is a way that we can include
      style attribute into the opening tag. The internal style is a way that we
      can include style in the head tag of HTML file. The last one is a
      traditional one. It's call external style. It's a seperate file for CSS.
      It's commonly use because it's convenience for troubleshooting. External
      style use the link tag to link between HTML and CSS files together.

      In CSS, if we would like to style something we would select it first. The
      selector is a way to select any tag, class, and id in HTML file.
      Afterthat, we can define any style by property and value method. Here is
      my cheatsheet for it.
